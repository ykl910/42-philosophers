# 42 Philosophers 🥢🧠

This project is part of the 42 Paris curriculum and explores the classic **Dining Philosophers** problem.

## Overview 🧐

The project has two parts:

- **Mandatory:**  
  Uses **threads** and **mutexes** 🧵🔒 to simulate philosophers who alternate between thinking, eating, and sleeping. Synchronization ensures no deadlocks or starvation.

- **Bonus:**  
  Implements the same simulation using **processes** and **semaphores** 🖥️🔐, adding complexity by handling inter-process communication and synchronization.

## Features ⭐

- Multithreaded simulation with mutex synchronization (mandatory part).  
- Process-based simulation using semaphores (bonus part).  
- Correct handling of timing ⏱️, synchronization, and termination conditions.  
- Optional argument to specify the number of times each philosopher must eat 🍽️.

## How to Compile 🛠️

```bash
make
```

## How to Run 🚀

```bash
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
